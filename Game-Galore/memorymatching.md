# Memory Matching Game

This is a simple **Memory Matching Game** built using Python and the `tkinter` library. The game involves finding pairs of matching cards on a 4x4 grid. It's easy to play and enjoyable for players of all ages.

## How to Play

1. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid of 16 cards (8 pairs).
2. Click on any two cards to flip them over.
3. If the two cards match, they will stay visible.
4. If the two cards don't match, they will flip back after a short delay.
5. The game ends when all pairs are matched, and a congratulatory message appears.

## Features

- A 4x4 grid layout for the game.
- Randomized shuffling of card pairs.
- Matching pairs will stay visible; mismatched pairs flip back.
- End-game message when all pairs are found.
